 > "A text-based linear RPG with multiple classes and a randomized loot system.  Incorporates a fleshed out combat system with interesting mechanics such as crits, consumables and Class abilities."
 > * Project Reason
 >   * We decided to work on this project because it seems like it would be fun to come up with and implement class abilities, weapon attributes, and creative enemy types. It would be interesting to examine a game through the lens of a developer instead of a user.
 > * Languages/Tools/Technology
 >   * [Github](https://github.com/) - an online version control repository to allow easy collaboration
 >   * [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) - a well-known object-based programming language
 >   * [Secure Shell](https://www.ssh.com/) - used to remotely access the UCR hammer server
 >   * [Github Kanban Board](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard) - Githubâ€™s version of an online framework to implement the Kanban work methodology
 > * Project Features
 >   * Text-based input/output, including entertaining ASCII art.
 >     * Using singular character inputs like "A, B, C" to navigate story and combat menus. Receiving output in the form of text descriptions of what is happening.
 >   * 5 Classes, each with a unique class ability in combat
 >     * Ex: Barbarians can go into rage to deal more damage.
 >   * 5 Weapons, each with unique attributes and modifiers
 >     * Ex: Rogue's knives deal damage twice instead of once.
 >   * Multiple potion types to use in combat
 >     * Ex: Choose to bring a strength potion instead of a healing potion.
 >   * Unique enemies, each with their own combat style
 >     * Ex: Stone golems take less physical damage and more magic damage.
 >   * Linear storyline, but randomized loot system based on your weapon and class

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also update this README file by adding the following:
 >   * What design pattern(s) did you use? For each pattern you must explain in 4-5 sentences:
 >     * Why did you pick this pattern? And what feature did you implement with it?
 >     *  Strategy, we picked this pattern to more easily make it so that we can use items more easily.
 >     * How did the design pattern help you write better code?
 >     *  It allowed up to create a more flexable interaction between the player and the item.
 >   * An updated class diagram that reflects the design pattern(s) you used. You may combine multiple design patterns into one diagram if you'd like, but it needs to be clear which portion of the diagram represents which design pattern (either in the diagram or in the description).
 >   * Make sure your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 >   Not very effective, alot of the team members were busy with midterms and everything so the things that we wanted to get done were not done.
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > *  We need to devople a more organized way to push to master, maybe encourage groupmmates to 
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA/reader during lab time. The TA/reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
